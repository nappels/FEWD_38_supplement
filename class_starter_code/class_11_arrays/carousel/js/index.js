// Instructions:
// In the images folder, you will find 8 food images (feel free to use other images if you want)
// By default, food1.jpg is shown on the page.

// 1) When a user clicks next, food2.jpg. If they click next again, food3.jpg should be shown and so on.

// 2) When a user clicks back, you should show the previous image. So if you currently showing food3.jpg,
// a click on previous would show food2.jpg. A click on previous again would show food1.jpg

// Start with an array that contains strings of all the image paths.
// You will also need a variable to keep track of which image is currently being shown to the user.
