# FEWD Week #3: CSS Layouts



### Description


Choose one of the two labs we started in the class this past week to turn in for homework. The most important thing is that you get it as close as you can to looking like the mock provided for each lab. There are always so many ways to accomplish the same thing when it comes to front end development, and this project is meant to get you thinking about and deciding on different ways to lay out content and style a page accoring to a mock.

### Technical Requirements

* From the mock of your choosing, use HTML and CSS to get your webpage as close to that mock as possible

* Use inline-block and/or floats in your CSS to achieve the correct layout according to the mock                                                               
* Create dummy pages that all link together via the navigation items. Optionally, you may add content to these pages.

* Use a unique `<title>` on each page                                                                                                                  
* Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages in addition to a CSS reset.

* Use HTML5 semantic elements to describe different sections of your content.

* Add a hover effect to all the links and/or navigation items using pseudo-classes

#### Bonus
* Use the correct ```Open Sans``` Google Font typeface to style the text denoted in the design file 

- Up for a real challenge? Use ```<script>``` tags in your HTML and [read ahead](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/) to make a dialogue box pop up when a user clicks "Sign Up Now!" that reads "We're Not Ready For Sign-Ups...Yet."
