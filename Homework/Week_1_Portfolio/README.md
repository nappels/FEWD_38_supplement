<br>

---


### Description


For the first assignment, you will begin creating the beginnings of your first website. Take what you've learned from class and build a portfolio site that showcases all of the projects you'll be completing over the next few weeks. Build two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio' - that link to one another. Your 'About Page' should describe your mission and value proposition and your 'Portfolio' should include [screenshots](starter_code/images) with descriptions of the work you [will] do for Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and CitiPix. Don't worry if you can't come up with any text for the pages--we've provided you with [some sample copy](starter_code/sample_copy.txt) that you can use.
